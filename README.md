# Effective permeability estimation of Canadian Shield granite based on physical information neural network (PINN)

## Abstract

In this study, the effective permeability of intact granite (Stanstead and Lac du Bonnet) on the east and west wings of the Canadian Shield was studied using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) method. The PINN method reconstructs the three-dimensional permeability field of granite by incorporating physical constraints such as Darcy's law and continuity equation into the neural network training process. Compared with the traditional finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM), the PINN method shows significant advantages in processing sparse data, solving inverse problems and quantifying uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, the PINN model of this study predicts the geometric mean effective permeability of Stanstead and Lac du Bonnet granites to be $59.1×10^{-19}m^2$ and $1.08×10^{-19}m^2$, respectively, which is highly consistent with the original research results ($59.3×10^{-19}m^2$ and $1.09×10^{-19}m^2$, respectively), confirming the accuracy of the PINN method. More importantly, the PINN method provides a continuous permeability field distribution, revealing the spatial variability of permeability inside granite, which is difficult to achieve with traditional methods. This study provides new research ideas and tools for the safety assessment and groundwater flow prediction of deep geological disposal repositories.

## Introduction

Deep geological disposal is the main solution for the safe disposal of high-level radioactive waste, and the permeability of rock is a key parameter for evaluating the long-term safety of disposal repositories. Granite in the Canadian Shield is considered an ideal host rock for waste disposal due to its low permeability and stable geological properties. Accurately estimating the effective permeability of granite is crucial for predicting groundwater flow and assessing the migration of radionuclides.

In traditional studies, Selvadurai et al. (2018) used the finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM) in Estimates for the Effective Permeability of Intact Granite Obtained from the Eastern and Western Flanks of the Canadian Shield, combined with the kriging spatial interpolation technique, to estimate the effective permeability of Stanstead and Lac du Bonnet granites on the eastern and western flanks of the Canadian Shield. This study interpolated discrete measurement points on the rock surface to generate the permeability distribution of the entire rock mass and calculate the effective permeability. However, the traditional method has the following limitations: (1) a large amount of surface measurement data is required; (2) it is difficult to process high-dimensional sparse data; (3) the interpolation process lacks physical constraints; (4) the uncertainty quantification is complex.

In recent years, physical information neural network (PINN), as a new type of scientific computing method, has shown great potential in solving complex physical problems by incorporating physical laws as soft constraints into the neural network training process (Raissi et al., 2019). Compared with traditional numerical methods, the PINN method can solve partial differential equations in a meshless manner, which is particularly suitable for dealing with inverse problems and data sparseness, and provides a new way to study the effective properties of complex materials.

The main objectives of this study are: (1) to establish a granite permeability model based on PINN, incorporating physical constraints such as Darcy's law and continuity equation into the neural network; (2) to reconstruct the three-dimensional permeability field of granite using limited surface measurement data; (3) to estimate the effective permeability of Stanstead and Lac du Bonnet granites; (4) to compare and analyze the results with those of traditional FEM/FDM methods; (5) to explore the advantages and application prospects of the PINN method in rock physical property research.

Through this study, we aim to demonstrate the application potential of the PINN method in the study of geological media physical properties and provide more reliable permeability parameters for the safety assessment of deep geological repositories.
